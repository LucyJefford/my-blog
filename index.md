Hi there, I'm Lucy Jefford and this is my blog!

If you'd like somewhere to start, this is a little bit [about me](https://lucyjefford.github.io/my-blog/about-me/).  
If you'd like to read about my summer internship, [this post](https://lucyjefford.github.io/my-blog/summer-internship/) talks about my experiences and my learning points. 

Below is a list of all my post, so click these to read more about me, and some of the work I've gotten up to. ðŸ˜Š
