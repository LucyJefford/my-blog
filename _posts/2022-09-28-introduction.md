Hey everyone! My name's Lucy and I am a 3rd year student at the University of Manchester, studying Computer Science.

My current interests are in Machine Learning and Computer Graphics, however I honestly just love problem solving. Any challenge that gets me excited and interested, will get me hooked for hours. That's why I love software engineering, as you've always got more problems to solve and solutions to invent.

I love to write, both code and creative writing, but I love the creativity that is used in both of them. I

I am have experience in Full Stack development - I appreciate the flexibility this gives me, which helps me solve my problems in many ways.
