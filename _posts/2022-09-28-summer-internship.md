## My Summer
For the past 3 months, I've been employed at THG in a Software Engineering role. The team I was placed in was their internal tools team, called THG Unify.   
I've absolutely loved my time there, and everyone was amazing. They supported me as I learnt my way around their code, and as I slowly learnt their best practices.

## Technologies
When I joined the team I had very little experience in the stack they were using. I've previously done mainly Java and Python development, with a little C/C++ because of uni.  
They jumped me straight in with using Typescript and React on the frontend, and Node.js or Go (depending on the project) for the backend.   
CI/CD tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Github workflows were all completely new to me

## Agile Development
I hadn't done much web development before, but I really enjoyed the way the team worked, and how manageable most of the tickets were.  They worked in sprints of 2 weeks, and I also enjoyed the daily standups.  
I am starting my 3rd Year Project at the start of this academic year, and I want to include so much of these practices. Particularly the regular delivery of tickets to the users, this was really exciting as we got to get feedback quickly from them. A few times, they reached out to our Product Manager to comment on particular tickets that I had worked on, which was lovely to hear!
  
## Tickets
At the start I mainly worked on small (1 or 2 point) tickets, usually accessibility tickets or minor bug fixes. I was constantly learning: best naming practices; accessibility requirements; React hooks and how to fix state bugs.  

Some of my favourite tickets were toward the end of my internship, as I gained so much more confidence with my work and I felt strong enough to work on more complicated tickets.

### Highlights

1. **Click-Away Protection**  
    When you were editing a large section of code, it used to not warn you when you clicked off the modal. The change I made meant the user had to confirm that they wanted to discard their changes.  
    We got so many messages about this really simple fix, as it saved so much work from being lost! This wasn't a big fix but the impact it had on our users was huge.  
1. **Ainsley - Productivity Bot**  
    Ainsley is a small bot which used Kubernetes Cronjobs to provide useful updates for the team.  
    I worked on this project entirely by myself, and learnt so much about webhooks and how to integrate APIs.  
    The main features were 
    - A Pull Request reminder, which (3 times a day) sent a message in our Teams Channel with a list of all the open PRs across the team's github.  
    This increased closing PRs significantly, dropping from 28 to 12 PRs in the few days after it was set up.
    - A Standup Order generator, to randomly generate the order for the daily standup.  

    I loved this feature, as it was all completely new to me, and I had to learn all about Docker, Kubernetes and the GitHub API to work on this.
2. **Announcements Panel**  
    There wasn't a feature to let our user-base know about the new features we're putting out. I worked with a few others to develop a reusuable frontend component that could easily be implemented across all the apps.  
    This panel was a really great learning experience for me, and I learnt new ways to structure my code and adapt my solutions for reusuability.
3. **Project Management Tools**  
    As a part of the app, you could manage a project. I implemented a feature which allowed you to collect information about your project in dashboard-like panels.  
    This was the first full-stack ticket that I led, and a great feature for me because I started to do some really in-depth work in Go, and this was completely outside of my comfort zone. I learnt so much as it went on, and I had a great time with it.   
    
    This was the biggest ticket that I worked on, and it was my last ticket in the team. I felt so proud of the difference between my first ticket and the last. It really showed me how my confidence and skills had developed, beyond what I thought I could have achieved at the start.

## Feedback & Learning Points
Towards the end of my internship, I got a lot of feedback from the people I had been working with.  
I really appreciated all their kind words, and in particular all the advice they gave me. 
However they gave me some really good learning points, so I thought I'd share it with you guys as well.

My favourite was
> "Don't believe your inner demon"  

Because this feels like something everyone can apply, in and out of work. I have always struggled with a bit of imposter syndrome, but everyone there supported me and made me feel like they know how I'm feeling. I had such a positive time there, and I feel in such a better place to start my third year, and the 3rd Year Project that is about to fill up my days!

Thanks to everyone at THG Unify for making my summer a wonderful experience, thank you for being awesome!
